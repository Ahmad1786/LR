# LR
Implement Linear Regression from scratch with different variations

# 1 LR for Classification
# 2 LR to find initial weights to use in Perceptron Learning Algorithm
# 3 LR on non-linear data
# 4 LR with Linear Transformation to classify non-linear data

Also generate artificial noise for some examples.
